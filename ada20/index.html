<h2><ins>So, what are dinosaurs?</ins></h2>

<p id="caption">Dinosaurs: A diverse group of reptiles that first appeared during the Triassic. They were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups.</p>
