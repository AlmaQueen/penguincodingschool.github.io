<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog was born on June 23, 3964 to Jules and Bernie. He started Jedi Training when he was 3. He trained with Silverstar. When he was 8, his parents were both hit by a monster and they were also crushed instantly(like Whitethroat in Warriors). Uncle Chuck was maimed for life. He graduated from high school and college. He met Antoine's father, Armand as a Padawan. On Sonic's 28th birthday, he married Sally Acorn.</p>
<h3>Padawan life(Sonic the Hedgehog Jedi #18)</h3>
<p>On June 30, 3988, he met Mina Mongoose the lead singer of the Forget-Me Knots.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Taboo(Sonic the Hedgehog Jedi #20)</h3>
<p>On July 1, 3988, He battled Darth Destructix with Warheart but unfortunately, his Jedi Master got stabbed in the torso. Later he sliced Darth Destructix in half.</p>
<h3>Invasion of Acorn(Sonic the Hedgehog Jedi #17)</h3>
<p>Ten years after the Battle of Taboo, Warheart's Jedi Master went to the dark side and became Darth Shader. He currently was a Jedi master of Mina Mongoose but he decided to find other Clones to help him. Unfortunately, a reckless bounty hunter defeated him. In the Battle of Efrika, Sonic, Tails, and his girlfriend were both captured. Later, Silverstar rescued them so Knuckleclaw decapitated Bobby pig. After that, Shadkin defeated Sonikkinfur by giving him a sharp cut on his right arm. Unfortunately, Mina lost her right arm. Later, Mina got married.</p>
<h3>The Curse of Metal Sonic(Sonic the Hedgehog Jedi#1-4)</h3>
<p>A year later, Sonic and Tails went to buy presents for his birthday but his best friend Tails caught epilepsy. On the Flying Van, Mina Mongoose punished him for helping Tails by breaking his right arm and also did it to his son. He didn't know Mina would go to the dark side. Three months later, he told Mina's mother that her daughter seduced to the dark side. She killed all of the younglings, put a curse on the Cap and was also decieved by Eggface. At Sonic's house, his wife turned into a teapot and his daughter turned into a teacup. Later, he headed for Mobifar but Mina force-choked her mother. Later Sonic fought with Mina. Meanwhile, Melody had dinner. As Minapaw got closer, she just tried to get the high ground but she lost her legs to Sonic and was left to burn in Mobifar, a volcanic planet like Darth Vader being left to burn in Mustafar after Obi-Wan defeated Vader. Even though she was all better, Sonic exiled and took Melody, Mina's daughter and Skyler, Mina's son to different places, he took Skyler to the jungle while taking Melody to Paris where he exiled.</p>
<h3>Acorn to the Hope(Sonic the Hedgehog Jedi #5-8)</h3>
<p>Eleven years after Sonic exiled, Melody finds him in a French hotel.When checking out a French hotel, he taught Melody and took her as one of his last padawan. Meanwhile, a space station was being built by the Imperal Alliance when Skye Prower and Skyler the feral child were both captured just like Leia in a New Hope. Later, the Imperial Officers burned down Skyler's orphanage.</p>
