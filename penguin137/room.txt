You awake in a dusty field with a throbbing headache. Unsure of where you are, you spot a barren path leading to a town in the distance. Following the path, you see an offshoot leading to a cave. Would you like to enter the cave or continue on the path?

The town is abandoned: windows boarded up, broken funiture littering porches and streets, and a thin layer of tan-gray dust coating everything. A large military vehicle is embedded into what appears to be the collapsed remains of a large home and the town's school is relatively intact and could have food or water; maybe even painkillers for your head. Would you like to loot the vehicle or enter the school, or turn around and head to the cave?
