BEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP, is the first sound you hear as you sit up in your HBC. 
You hear a voice welcome you to the year 4017.
You crane your neck to see a small screen on the inside of the coffin. 
On the screen is some small text. Do you want to read it? (yes/no)

It reads: Hello passenger, welcome to the year 4017. 
Although you don't remember it, you have been aboard the Sea Dragon for 50 years. 
Most of the other passengers should be waking up soon. 
Looking around you should see two hatches. DO NOT OPEN AIRLOCK UNLESS INSTRUCTED.
Take the right hatch and await further instruction. 
Press the button below to close the letter. (press button)

But you're curious to see what's inside the other rooms. (enter room/walk hallway)

There was nothing but empty space on the other side of the airlock. 
You barely have time to react as the room instantly depressurizes, killing you and blowing up the entire module.
