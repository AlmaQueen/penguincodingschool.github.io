<h3>Quick mate</h3>
This will only work on beginers so do not try it on good chess players. Most of them already know this.The first on is called Scholors mate.
<br> White goes E4, Then with the standerd opening black goes E5, Bc4. At this point look at your opponent if he/she knows this bring your king side night out. If he/ does not reconize this go Qh5 then mate with Qf7. <br>(This is in standerd notation if you do not reconize this look it up. It is very important for any chess player to know. <br>Please go to the link bellow it is a great website for quick and long mates.

<h4>Long mate</h4>
My favorite begining to any game is to go E4 the if my opponent does E5 go NC3 this opens up the chance to go with Fried Liver Atack or go into a boring slow game.1. E4 E5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. Exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+then this is where most of the different variations begin!
