<i>These are some facts you need to know about swimming.</i>

<h2>Let's go easy</h2>
<p>Question:</p>
<em>How many <ins>main strokes</ins> are there in swimming and what are they? </em>
<p>Firstly, there is a stroke called freestyle, or as people call it, frontcrawl. </p>

<p><em>"The freestyle stroke, also known as front crawl, is the fastest and most efficient of the competitive swimming strokes. That's why it is always used in the freestyle event of swimming competitions and is also often the preferred stroke of experienced swimmers and triathletes."</em></p>

<p>Next, there is a stroke called backstroke, where you are on your back,:) and rotate you shoulders to make you faster. </p>
<p><em>"Backstroke is one of the four swimming styles used in competitive events regulated by FINA, and the only one of these styles swum on the back. This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of swimmers not being able to see where they are going. It is also the only competition swimming style that has a different start. The swimming style is similar to an upside down front crawl. Both backstroke and front crawl are long-axis strokes. In individual medley backstroke is the second style swum; in the medley relay it is the first style swum."</em></p>

<p> Next up, is breastroke.</p>
<p><em>"Breaststroke is a swimming style in which the swimmer is on their chest and the torso does not rotate. It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer's head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds. In most swimming classes, beginners learn either the breaststroke or the front crawl first. However, at the competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires comparable endurance and strength to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke as the "frog" stroke, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest of all swimming strokes."</em></p>

<p> Lastly, the fourth stroke is butterfly. Many people say that this stroke is their worst and usually complain about the stroke.</p>
