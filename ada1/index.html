<h1>Warrior Cats: All You Want To Know!</h1>
<p><h2>This website will teach you all about the warrior cats from Warriors by Erin Hunter.</h2></p>
<h2>Clans</h2>
There are four main clans in warriors; ThunderClan, ShadowClan, RiverClan, and WindClan. They each ahve territories and hunting grounds in a camp. There are dens for different groups of cats in the camp. When a cat dies, it joins StarClan, a clan made entirely on dead cats. There are also loners and kittypets. A loner is a wild cat with no clan or that ran away from their clan. A kittypet is a housecat, or a pet that is cared for by humans. There <i>were</i> other clans like LionClan, CheetahClan, and TigerClan, but they are no longer around. However, they still live in groups. BloodClan is a deadly clan lead by a deadly cat called Scourge. Scourge can kill a leader in one strike, and a leader has <i><b>nine lives!!!</b></i>BloodClan is feared by most cats in the wild who know how hard wild life already is.

<h2>Cat Ranks</h2>
There are eight cat ranks; Kit, Apprentice, Warrior,Elder, Medicine Cat, Queen, Deputy, and last but definently not least, Leader. A kit is a baby cat under 6 moons, or months, old. An apprentice is a young cat past the age of kit that is training to become a warrior. A warrior is a cat fighting to protect their clan. A medicine cat is the healer of the clan. if someone gets hurt, the medicine cat helps them. Medicine cats get messages from StarClan. A queen is a female expecting or nursing kits. An elder is a warrior who is too old to keep protecting and fighting. A leader is he or she whom runs the clan. A deputy is he or she chosen as an assistant boss by the leader. When the leader dies, the deputy <i>usually</i>becomes leader.Those are the eight cat ranks in the clan.
