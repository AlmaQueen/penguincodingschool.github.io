<h2>Code</h2>

A Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, trained in the ways of the light side of the Force, could take comfort in the words of the mantra of the Jedi Code:<br>

There is no emotion, there is peace.<br>
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.<br>
There is no passion, there is serenity.<br>
There is no chaos, there is harmony.<br>
There is no death, there is the Force.<br>
There also existed an alternate version of the Code, recited by Jedi younglings during their Initiate Trials, and by Depa Billaba during her full fitness re-assessment after waking up from her 6-month coma:<br>

Emotion, yet peace.<br>
Ignorance, yet knowledge.<br>
Passion, yet serenity.<br>
Chaos, yet harmony.<br>
Death, yet the Force.
