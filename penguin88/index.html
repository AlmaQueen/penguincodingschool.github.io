<h1><p>root for android devices</p></h1>
<h2>cydia lets you do a lot of things like free in app purcheses.  (pressing buy then cancel will some how pay for the purches. But it dosen't work for all games like online games.) Also most people get cydia for there phones not to hack but to change the look. and by look I mean icon look, swipe animation and boot animation. usualy to jailbrake people use jailbrake me on ios 7.0.2 or pangu jailbrake for ios 9 and 10</h2>
<h2><p>i think that the ace theme looks really nice <li><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjoyLCzs83UAhWMWD4KHXGuC1IQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techgiri.com%2Fhack%2Ftweaks%2Fwinterboard-update-for-ios-9-brings-best-themes-available-on-cydia%2F&psig=AFQjCNFlWlP3OYf8RyGPnGxScygkzIk__A&ust=1498081708328554">theme</a></li>

<h2><p>root is for android and it let's you give root access to spicific apps that recvire root to work like freedom or game jem which are used to get free in app purchuses like on iphones but its a lot easier to root android because you usauly dont need a computer. people usualy use king root, kingo root and super-su to root there phones</p></h2>
<h2><p>kingo root dosent require computer but has a lower chance of success (But safe)  </p></h2>
<h2><p>king root has a slightly more success rate (it works for more divices) (safe)</p></h2>
<h2><p>super su has a high success rate (but its has the most chance of getting your divice stuck in a boot loop) </p></h2>
