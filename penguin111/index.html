<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><ins>The Warriors</ins> is about a cat named Rusty who is a house cat. One day, he meets cats from the forest who invite him to join the in the wild. But, once he makes the decision, he cannot change his mind. Rusty makes the decision to join them, and his greatest adventures have just begun!</p>

<p>In the wild, there are five clans: Thunderclan, Riverclan, Windclan, Shadowclan, and Starclan. Unlike the others, Starclan is located up in the stars, and is the clan where cats go when they die. It is where their ancestors live. The four clans are rivals, but they all worship Starclan. The main character lives in Thunderclan.</p>


<h2>Map</h2>

<p>This is the map of the setting, where the whole story takes place. The book mentions a bunch of these places throughout the story, so this map will be very helpful. </p>

<h2>More Books</h2>

<p>In addition, there are extra books that tell about the stroy before the series, and bring you deep inside each clan. There are also guide books for warriors, which tell you the basic things to know about the warriors. Kind of like my website!</p>

<p>If you like <ins>The Warriors</ins>, you may also enjoy <ins>The Seekers</ins>, and <ins>The Survivors</ins>, also by Erin Hunter. One series is about dogs, and another about bears.</p>
