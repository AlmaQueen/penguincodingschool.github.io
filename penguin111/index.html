<p>Rusty first lives in a house with his owners. He was born as a kittypet and has brothers and sisters. But he dreams about living in the forest and experiencing the wild. One day he meets wild cats in the forest and gets the opportunity to live with them. He choses to go with them, and leave his old life behind forever.</p>

<p>Rusty now lives in ThunderClan, and gets the name Firepaw as an apprentice. He makes friends with Graypaw, and Ravenpaw. He gets bullied by some cats like Dustpaw, but otherwise he trains like a normal apprentice.</p>

<p>Then comes the time for Firepaw to become a warrior. His warrior name is Fireheart. During his time as a warrior, he makes many great accomplishments that the other clans can thank him for. He helped Shadowclan drive out Brokenstar because he was hungry for power. He helped bring Windclan back home from being driven out by Brokenstar. He helped feed Riverclan when their camp was flodded, and their river was poluted by humans. And he faught loyally with his own home clan. Later, he was made deputy after Tigerclaw's exile, because he was the only one Bluestar (Thunderclan leader) trusted. Not long after, His leader died honorably, fighting to save her clan.</p>

<p>Because deputy always replaces leader, Fireheart takes Bluestar's place and takes the name Firestar. He travels to highstones to be granted nine lives by Starclan, and officially be Thunderclan's leader.</p>

<p>Graypaw is one of the first cats Firestar meets on his first day. They become best friends along with Ravenpaw. Graypaw is clan born, unlike Firestar, so he has been apprenticed before him. His mentor was Lionheart, a wise senior warrior.</p>

<p>After all his training, Graypaw becomes a warrior with Firepaw. His warrior name is Graystripe. He goes on many adventures with Fireheart, and is a loyal clan cat. Although, he falls in love with a she-cat from Riverclan, Silverstream, and meets with her in secret. This causes friendship problems between him and Fireheart because Fireheart doesn't like it when his friend is absent from camp, and breaking the warrior code. Eventually, Graystripe listens to his friend and agrees to only meet with her at gatherings.</p>

<p>One day, he finds out he has kits. Graystripe is a father! But when Silverstream starts kitting, it all goes wrong. Thunderclan's medicine cat, Cinderpelt, tries to help, but Silverstream doesn't make it. This is a great burden for him, that took a while to get over. Luckilly, two of his kits survived and became aprentices.</p>
