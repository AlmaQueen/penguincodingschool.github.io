<h1>Flappy cow</h1>
<b>Flappy cow is a game that is very simular to flappy bird, except that instead of a bird, it's a cow. Flappy cow must travel trough the "pipes" in order to score a point. You must click in order for the cow to fly. Whenever flappy cow hits a "pipe" or falls to the ground, the game will be over, and the score will reset itself.<b>
