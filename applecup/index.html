<h1>Agario page</h1>
<h2>This site is about Agario!Agar.io is my favorite game.The objective of Agar.io is to Eat other people.I know it does not soumd like a fun game but once you start playing it then you are going to love it!Mass is something that helps you get bigger and if you get on to leader board you start spliting by pressing the spacebar.Sometimes you  split and unknowingly you get eaten by someone else it is oka. Teaming is a very good way to get on the leaderboard!I will add more things later>(This is my first time making it I hope you like it!)</h2>
