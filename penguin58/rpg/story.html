  It's been more than a year since you first discovered the treasure map, and only now have you figured out where it starts. However, now that you've started to travel down the path, you have reached an issue. The map shows two paths: One leades up a mountain, and the other skirts the base to meet up with the mountain route later on. There might be a clue at the toip of the mountain, but it would take time, and you're not really prepared for climbing a steep mountain. Which path do you want to take?
