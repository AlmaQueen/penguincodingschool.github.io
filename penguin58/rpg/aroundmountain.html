  Because the mountain looks to difficult to trek, you have dicided to go around the base instead. After hiking along the trail for a while, you round a corner and come across a river. It looks very deep, and the current is strong. The other bank, is far away. After looking at the options, you see only three options: You could try to swim across the river and continue along the path, or you could go along the river and try to find a place where the distance between the two banks is shorter, and try to swim across. However, you would have to get back to the path to continue. The final choice that you could make is to somehow make a raft out of some of the trees on the forest next to you. The raft might take a lot of time to make, as would going downriver to find another place to cross. How do you want to try and get across the river?
