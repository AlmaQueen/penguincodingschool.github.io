  After struggling against the current, you've manadged to reach the opposite bank- but in doing so, the current has pushed you far downstream. As you were swimming, you saw a lot of dense forest, and you don't know if you can get through the forest back to the path. However, you knew that there was a village not too far along the river- but it is in the opposite direction that you want to go. You could go to the village and try to find a way to get back go to the trail...or push through the forest towards the trail. How will you get back to the treasure path?
