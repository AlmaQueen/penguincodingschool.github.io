  The mountain turns out to be very tall, and you've underestimated the ammount of time it would take to reach the top. Now, you've reached a glacier. It looks stable, and you can't see any crevases...but they might just be hiddne under the snow. You don't have any equipment for ice trekking, but the summit is just past this point. You could also hike back down, find a nearby village, and buy ice climbing equipment, but that would take a lot of time. Of course, you could also go down and skirt the mountain. There are so many choices to take, and it is growing darker. Where do you want to go?
