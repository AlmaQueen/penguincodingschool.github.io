<h2>Registration</h2>
<br>
<br>
<b>If you arrive on the day of the competition to register, things are usually going to be more hectic than getting it out of the way a week before. If there is a competition with some sort of website or blogpost for updates, keep in touch with that. Coaches and instructors either hand out copies of registration forms to be mailed or recommend competitors to fill out an online form, if present.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Information normally found in competition forms are age, gender, belt level, which events the competitor is participating in, weight (if sparring), contact information, etc.</b>
