<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size: 80px; color: brown;">African Elephants</h1>

<h2>African Elephants have very large feet and a very long trunk.</h2>
<p>African Elephants are amazing animals. They are highly intelligent and have a wide range of low frequency calls that they can hear over miles of savanna land. The African Elephant mothers are extremely protective of their young calves. The young elephant creates a strong relationship between him/her and their mother. But poachers have been tearing apart these wonderful families, and do they think that Elephants don't have the same greif and shock that whe have when we see a family member die?</p>
