You don't remember anything,
you don't remember anyone.
There are blurry shapes around you
that eventually solidify into people.
"Sleeping beauty has arisin!" yelled a voice.
"Where-" you start.
"Stop talking, you need water," said a firm voice as some water is poured into your mouth.
"Now you can talk," said the same voice. 
"Where am I?" you ask the people around you.
"You are in a cellar below a house near the corner of town. It is a really old one, and going to collapse. We need to get out of here now."
"Stop hurrying him, Jake. We can spend a little more time making sure Parker recovers."
